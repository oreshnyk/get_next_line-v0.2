Gather up all of the crew!
It's time to ship out Bink's brew!
Sea wind blows
To where? Who knows?
The waves will be our guide!
O'er across the ocean's tide
Rays of sunshine far and wide
Birds they sing of cheerful things, in circles passing by!
Bid farewell to weaver's town!
Say so long to port renowned!
Sing a song, it won't be long, before we're casting off!
Cross the gold and silver seas
The salty spray puts us at ease!
Day and night to our delight
The voyage never ends!
Gather up all of the crew!

It's time to ship out Bink's brew!
Pirates we, eternally are challenging the sea!
With the waves to rest our heads
Ship beneath us as our beds!
Hoisted high upon the mast our Jolly Roger flies!
Somewhere in the endless sky
Stormy winds are blowin' by!
Waves are dancing, evening comes
It's time to sound the drums!
But steady men may never fear!
Tomorrow's skies are always clear!
So pound your feet and clap your hands till sunny days return!

Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho

Gather up all of the crew!
It's time to ship out Bink's brew!
Wave good-bye, but don't you cry
Our memories remain
Our days are but a passing dream, everlasting though they seem
'neath the moon we'll meet again, the wind's our lullaby!
Gather up all of the crew!
It's time to ship out Bink's brew!
Sing a song and play along
For all the ocean's wide!
After all is said and done
You'll end up a skeleton!
So spread your tale, from dawn till dusk, upon these foamy seas!

Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho
